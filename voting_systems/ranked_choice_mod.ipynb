    "# Ranked Choice Voting\n",
    "\n",
    "Ranked Choice Voting (RCV), also known as Instant Runoff Voting, is a voting system that allows voters to rank candidates in order of preference. Instead of selecting just one candidate, voters have the option to rank multiple candidates from their most preferred to least preferred.\n",
    "\n",
    "In RCV, the counting process involves multiple rounds. In each round, the candidate with the fewest first-choice votes is eliminated. The votes for the eliminated candidate are then redistributed to the remaining candidates based on the voters' next preferences. This process continues until one candidate receives a majority of the votes.\n",
    "\n",
    "RCV is designed to ensure that the winning candidate has the support of the majority of voters. It also allows voters to express their preferences for multiple candidates without worrying about \"wasting\" their vote on a less popular candidate."
